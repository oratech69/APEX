I created this Kanban Board in Oracle APEX that allows you to drag and drop cards between different system development lifecycle tasks. This is not a plugin. I used HTML5 Drag n Drop features in this project. The pictures on the cards are fetched from a database table. When you switch a card to another task, an Ajax Callback process immediately updates the backend table. Each task is provided as a link on the card that, when clicked, calls a modal page to update task details. Similarly, the plus sign that appears under each SDLC pane, lets you create a new task.
